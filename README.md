# audacious-filetree-search
A modification of the search-tool-qt plugin from audacious-plugins
https://github.com/audacious-media-player/audacious-plugins

It creates a searchable filetree that updates the current playlist (bar the Library playlist) as you click on folders
Folders can be double clicked to expand/collapse or the user can single click the arrows.

I haven't figured out how to keep the last track playing when the playlist changes - I hope someone does.
