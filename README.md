# audacious-filetree-search  
A modification of the search-tool-qt plugin from audacious-plugins  
https://github.com/audacious-media-player/audacious-plugins  

Made to work with https://github.com/Zineffable1/audacious-widget  

It creates a searchable filetree that updates the current playlist (bar the Library playlist) as you single click on folders  
Folders can be double clicked to expand/collapse or the user can single click the arrows.  

Made a seperate playlist called Browser, this is what updates when you select items from the filetree, so you can now keep playing music while looking through your library.
